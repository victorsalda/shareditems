    "# PYTHON GEOSPATIAL LIBRARIES\n",
    "# A. Throughout my global postdoc journey (2022–2025), I’ve curated a collection of 135+ Python libraries\n",
    "#    that can potentially power modern geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI).\n",
    "# B. As a Geospatial Engineer with a PhD in Geomatics Engineering, I’ve approached this ecosystem with\n",
    "#    both practical field awareness and scientific rigor.\n",
    "# C. The collection spans foundational data manipulation, visualization, coordinate systems,\n",
    "#    cloud‑native raster formats, deep learning frameworks, spatial databases, web GIS engines, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NOTES OF CAUTION:\n",
    "# 1. Not every library has been stress‑tested across all environments, and their maturity varies widely.\n",
    "# 2. Many tools were created by developers who are not geospatial engineers or geoscience specialists, which means\n",
    "#    that EO calculations, coordinate handling, projection transformations, datum integrations,\n",
    "#    geodetic system analysis, and spatial assumptions require significantly more scrutiny.\n",
    "# 3. Only a small subset of these libraries has undergone rigorous validation, offers extensive documentation,\n",
    "#    or has been hardened through real‑world production use. Expect inconsistencies, undocumented edge cases,\n",
    "#    and gaps in functionality.\n",
    "# 4. Several libraries also come with restrictive or unclear commercial‑use licenses, so always verify\n",
    "#    licensing terms before integrating them into production or client‑facing systems.\n",
    "# 5. Installation methods vary—some work seamlessly with pip or conda, while others require manual builds,\n",
    "#    system‑level dependencies, or environment isolation to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "# 6. Use this collection as a starting point for exploration, but always conduct your own due diligence\n",
    "#    before using or deploying any library in your geospatial work.\n",
    "# 7. I welcome contributions, corrections, and suggestions to improve this ecosystem over time.\n",
    "# 8. Happy coding and geospatial exploration!\n",
